# Figuration Slider Widget

Slider is a robust replacement for the HTML5 element `<input type="range">` with the addition of being able to be used for ranged/multi-thumb input.

Built to work with the [Figuration](http://figuration.org) framework.

This is currently a holding ground for the Slider widget that used to be included in v3 of Figuration, but was removed in v4 in favor of a custom styled `<input type="range">`.

Dependencies:
- [jQuery](http://jquery.com/)
- [Figuration](http://figuration.org)

Features:
- Can be attached to an `input`, other than `type=range`, or `select` controls.
- Supports ranged, or mutli-thumb, value selection.
- When using a ranged slider, the thumbs/handles are constrained by the value of the other thumb/handle.
